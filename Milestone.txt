Currently I'm working on developing the skills to implement a graphical preview
that allows the user to visually verify that the curl they have specified is
what they want.

Basically, the user will adjust taper starts, inflection points, and curl density
to create a specific shape. The program itself is really about the math of
converting this shape to a standard bar size with the same volume, but the
graphical preview will let the user see a rough design of the shape to verify
they are doing what they want.

As for the main functionality, I'm not sure how exactly to calculate the volume of
a complex shape like a curl, but I think that doing things in steps might work.
That is, to take the complex shape, and mathematically deconstruct it into a straight
piece with specific tapers. Once I have the total length of the bar unrolled, I will
calculate the volume and then calculate the volumes of the tapered pieces and subtract
the difference, leaving the correct volume. Then I'll take the max diameter of the
complex shape and calculate the length needed in the next few standard bar sizes up.

NOTE: I mistakenly named it CS 461 instead of 407, I'll probably go back and fix this later.
